# End-to-End Authentication & User Synchronization

## What This Is

A robust authentication and user synchronization flow between Clerk, the NestJS backend, and the Next.js frontend for Populatte. Request-time sync ensures users are always available in the local database when making authenticated API calls, with a type-safe API client on the frontend that handles token management, retry logic, and runtime response validation.

## Core Value

**Every authenticated request must have access to the local database user entity — not just the Clerk ID.** Controllers never manually fetch users; the auth infrastructure handles it transparently.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ ClerkAuthGuard validates JWT tokens — existing
- ✓ SyncUserUseCase creates/updates users from Clerk data — existing
- ✓ Webhook-based user sync (Clerk → API) — existing
- ✓ Drizzle schema with users table (clerkId, email, name, imageUrl) — existing
- ✓ Clean Architecture layers (Core/Infrastructure/Presentation) — existing
- ✓ Clerk integration on frontend (ClerkProvider, middleware) — existing
- ✓ Auth guard performs request-time user sync (create if not found, update metadata) — v1.0
- ✓ Auth guard attaches local User entity to request (not just clerkId) — v1.0
- ✓ ClerkService extracts full user claims from JWT (email, name, imageUrl) — v1.0
- ✓ CurrentUser decorator returns local User entity — v1.0
- ✓ API client with automatic Clerk token injection — v1.0
- ✓ 401 error handling with token refresh + retry — v1.0
- ✓ Type-safe API response handling with Zod schemas — v1.0

### Active

(None — next milestone requirements TBD via `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- OAuth/social login providers — Clerk handles this upstream
- Roles/permissions system — future milestone
- Session management UI — handled by Clerk components
- API rate limiting — separate infrastructure concern
- Webhook changes — existing webhook flow remains intact
- Request-scoped caching for sync — deferred to optimization milestone
- SkipUserSync decorator — deferred to optimization milestone
- Selective sync with lastSyncedAt — deferred to optimization milestone
- Request queueing during token refresh — deferred to frontend enhancement milestone

## Context

**Shipped v1.0** with 4,244 LOC TypeScript across 65 files.
Tech stack: NestJS 11, Next.js 16, PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), Clerk, TanStack Query v5, Zod v4.

**Architecture patterns established:**
- Compare-first sync: Guard fetches stored user, compares fields, writes only on mismatch
- Guard syncs, controller consumes: Zero-database-lookup controller pattern
- Dual sync paths: Guard (request-time) vs SyncUserUseCase (webhook)
- Dual API clients: Client-side (useApiClient with 401 retry) vs Server-side (createServerApiClient)
- Factory pattern for endpoints: `createUserEndpoints(fetchFn)` composable with any fetch implementation
- Smart retry: No 4xx retry, exponential backoff for 5xx/network errors

**Known tech debt:**
- Clerk JWT Dashboard config needs human re-verification if template changes (low severity)

## Constraints

- **SOLID Principles**: All implementations must follow Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled, explicit return types
- **Language**: All code, comments, and documentation in English
- **Existing Structure**: Must fit within established Clean Architecture layers
- **No Breaking Changes**: Webhook flow must continue working alongside request-time sync

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Request-time sync creates users | Eliminates race condition where user authenticates before webhook | ✓ Good |
| Sync on every request (compare-first) | Keeps user metadata fresh, skips write if unchanged | ✓ Good |
| Guard attaches full User entity | Controllers work with internal User, not Clerk concepts | ✓ Good |
| Fetch wrapper over Axios | Simpler, no extra dependency, aligns with Next.js patterns | ✓ Good |
| Token refresh + retry on 401 | Better UX than immediate redirect; handles token expiry gracefully | ✓ Good |
| Separate client/server fetch wrappers | Different token acquisition, env vars, retry strategies | ✓ Good |
| Clerk skipCache (not forceRefresh) | Correct Clerk API for forcing fresh tokens | ✓ Good |
| Guard calls upsert directly (not SyncUserUseCase) | Compare-first optimization is different from webhook's unconditional upsert | ✓ Good |
| DATABASE_URL replaces SUPABASE_URL | Consistency across drizzle.config, database.config, env validation | ✓ Good |
| Partial unique index on clerkId | Allows re-creation of soft-deleted users with same clerkId | ✓ Good |
| HealthModule marked @Global() | Cross-module SyncFailureIndicator injection without circular deps | ✓ Good |
| Zod safeParse for runtime validation | Explicit error handling with detailed logging | ✓ Good |
| Factory pattern for endpoints | Composable with any fetch implementation (hook or non-hook) | ✓ Good |
| Smart retry in QueryClient | No 4xx retry, exponential backoff for 5xx/network | ✓ Good |
| useState for stable QueryClient | Prevents cache loss on re-render | ✓ Good |
