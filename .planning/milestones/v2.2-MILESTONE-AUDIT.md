## Tech Debt

No tech debt introduced by v2.2 phases. Pre-existing items from earlier milestones remain unchanged.

**Phase 14 deviation (auto-fixed):** react-dropzone v14 type assertions needed for strict TypeScript — documented, no functional impact.

## Anti-Patterns

Zero TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholder text, console.log-only implementations, or stub patterns detected across all 4 phases.

## Artifacts Summary

| Phase | Files Created | Files Modified |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 13 | 6 (schemas, endpoints, hooks, page, empty state, breadcrumb) | 4 (client, barrel exports) |
| 14 | 1 (upload-batch-modal.tsx) | 1 (page.tsx) |
| 15 | 2 (batch-card.tsx, batch-grid.tsx) | 2 (batch-empty-state.tsx, page.tsx) |
| 16 | 5 (page.tsx, header, table, pagination, empty state) | 1 (use-batches.ts) |

**Total:** 14 files created, 8 files modified across 4 phases

## Human Verification Items (Non-Blocking)

These items were flagged by phase verifiers for optional manual QA:
- Visual polish: mode badge colors, responsive grid breakpoints, hover effects
- Drag-and-drop interaction: visual feedback on dragover, drop behavior
- Toast notifications: timing, positioning, Portuguese text
- Pagination smoothness: opacity transitions, page size reset behavior
- Breadcrumb navigation: click-through between all levels
- Cell tooltips: positioning, truncation behavior on wide tables
